# VRCX-0

English | [简体中文](README.zh-CN.md) | [日本語](README.ja-JP.md)

VRCX-0 is a fork of VRCX that replaces the previous CEF-based architecture with **Tauri + React**.
Development is led by one of VRCX's former core developers.

VRCX-0 is designed around players' everyday use: lower resource usage, a smaller app, and continued feature development and support.

The current VRCX project is largely stable, and future upstream changes are expected to focus mainly on maintenance and fixes. VRCX-0 will continue to receive new features, support, and roadmap updates.

## Highlights

- About 50%–70% lower memory usage compared to VRCX
- Windows and macOS installers are in the 20 MB range
- Much smaller application size
- New UI and interaction model
- Full keyboard navigation
- Continued feature development and support

## Data Migration

On first run, VRCX-0 can automatically migrate your existing VRCX database and settings.

Your original VRCX data is not modified.
Existing users can start using VRCX-0 with their current data without any manual setup.

## VROverlay

VROverlay support is planned.

It will be redesigned around practical use cases instead of directly reusing the old implementation.
